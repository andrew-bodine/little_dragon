syntax tree:
	how generic can we be with the node definitions? { num, id, op, ... }
	get print_tree going .: need to determine the max width and height, then print accordingly

symbol table:
	unique hash table for each scope
	hash table - hash( id ) indexed array of dynamic length
	each hash table entry points to a linked list of ids .: LL necessary in case of hash collisions -> compare on name to find correct id
	need a stack-like implementation for supporting scopes .: LL of hash tables? array of hash table pointers?

code generation:


-- next --
add in scoping '[' ... ']'
add in assignment '='
